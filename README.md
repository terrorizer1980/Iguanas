# What is Iguanas?

Iguanas is a fast, flexible and modular Python package for:

* Generating new rules using a labelled dataset.
* Optimising existing rules using a labelled or unlabelled dataset.
* Combining rule sets and removing/filtering those which are unnecessary.
* Generating rule scores based on their performance.

It aims to help streamline the process for developing a deployment-ready Rules-Based System (RBS) for **binary classification use cases**.

# Getting started

Instructions on installing and using Iguanas can be found in the [Iguanas documentation](https://paypal.github.io/Iguanas/).
